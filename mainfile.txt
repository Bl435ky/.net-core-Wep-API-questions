What are the two approaches to creating APIs in ASP.NET Core?
Controller-based APIs and minimal APIs.
How do controllers in an API project typically take dependencies?
Controllers take dependencies via constructor injection or property injection.
What is the purpose of minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core?
Minimal APIs simplify API development by focusing on configuration and extensibility via extension methods and lambda expressions.
What is the primary difference between controller-based APIs and minimal APIs in terms of structure?
Controller-based APIs use classes that derive from ControllerBase, whereas minimal APIs define endpoints with logical handlers using lambdas or methods, without explicit controller classes.
How do minimal APIs support dependency injection?
Minimal APIs access the service provider directly or use other approaches to achieve dependency injection.
Provide a sample code structure for a controller-based API project in ASP.NET Core.
The sample structure includes the creation of a WebApplication object, adding controller services, and mapping the controllers via app.MapControllers().
How are endpoints defined in a minimal API project?
Endpoints are defined in-line using lambda expressions, for example, app.MapGet("/route", handler).
How can a WeatherForecast API be implemented using controllers?
A WeatherForecastController class is created that defines a Get method to return an array of weather forecasts using a predefined set of summaries and random data.
How does the minimal API approach define routes and logic?
Routes and logic are defined inline using app.MapGet() and lambda functions without separate controller classes.
What class is used in both API approaches to represent weather data?
The WeatherForecast class.
How does the TemperatureF property calculate the Fahrenheit value in the WeatherForecast class?
The formula used is 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556).
What are some capabilities that minimal APIs share with controller-based APIs?
Both support scaling to multiple APIs, handling complex routes, applying authorization, and controlling API response content.
What are some features not supported by minimal APIs?
Features like built-in model binding, validation, application parts, custom conventions, view rendering, and OData are not supported by minimal APIs.
What is the IModelBinderProvider in ASP.NET Core?
It's an interface used to provide model binders in a controller-based API.
What is the purpose of the IModelValidator in a controller-based API?
It provides validation logic for models.
Why are Razor Pages recommended for rendering views instead of minimal APIs?
Minimal APIs do not support view rendering, while Razor Pages are designed for that purpose.
What is the JsonPatch operation, and why isn’t it supported by minimal APIs?
JsonPatch is used to partially update JSON objects, and minimal APIs lack built-in support for it.
In a web API, why should controllers derive from ControllerBase?
ControllerBase provides essential methods for handling HTTP requests without the overhead of view rendering, which is unnecessary for APIs.
What additional functionality does the Controller class provide compared to ControllerBase?
The Controller class adds support for views, which is useful for web pages but not for APIs.
How does the CreatedAtAction method in a controller handle HTTP responses?
It returns a 201 status code and a link to the newly created resource.
What does the BadRequest method return in ASP.NET Core controllers?
It returns a 400 status code, indicating a bad request.
What is the purpose of the NotFound method in a controller-based API?
It returns a 404 status code when a requested resource cannot be found.
How does the [ApiController] attribute change controller behavior?
It enforces attribute routing, automatic 400 responses for validation errors, and binding source inference.
What does attribute routing enforce when using [ApiController] in ASP.NET Core?
It requires all routes to be defined using attributes like [Route].
How does the [HttpGet] attribute work in a controller-based API?
It maps an action method to the HTTP GET verb.
What is the role of the [Consumes] attribute in an API controller?
It specifies the types of data that an action can accept, such as JSON or XML.
How does the [Produces] attribute define the return data type of a controller action?
It specifies the types of data that the action will return, such as JSON or XML.
How does automatic HTTP 400 response handling work with the [ApiController] attribute?
Validation errors trigger an automatic HTTP 400 response without needing explicit checks in the code.
Why is the ModelStateInvalidFilter used in ASP.NET Core MVC?
It checks for model validation errors and automatically returns a 400 status if validation fails.
What is the ValidationProblemDetails object used for in ASP.NET Core?
It provides a standardized format for validation errors in web API responses.
How can you log automatic 400 responses in an API controller?
By configuring the InvalidModelStateResponseFactory delegate to log validation errors before the 400 response is returned.
How can you disable the automatic HTTP 400 response behavior in a controller?
Set SuppressModelStateInvalidFilter to true in ApiBehaviorOptions.
What is binding source parameter inference in ASP.NET Core?
ASP.NET Core infers the binding source for action parameters based on their type and usage.
What is the role of the [FromBody] attribute in API controller parameters?
It specifies that the parameter's value should be read from the body of the HTTP request.
What types of parameters should use the [FromRoute] attribute?
Parameters whose values are part of the URL route.
How does [FromQuery] handle query string parameters in an API action?
It binds action method parameters to query string values in the URL.
What is inferred by the [FromServices] attribute in ASP.NET Core?
It indicates that a parameter should be provided by dependency injection.
How can you prevent automatic binding source inference for a specific parameter?
By explicitly applying a binding attribute, such as [FromBody] or [FromQuery], to the parameter.
How can automatic binding source inference be disabled globally in an ASP.NET Core application?
Set DisableImplicitFromServicesParameters to true in ApiBehaviorOptions.
How does the ASP.NET Core runtime handle complex object binding by default?
It attempts to bind complex objects from multiple sources, such as query strings and route data, unless a specific binding source is defined.
How can you disable automatic DI for parameters in a controller action?
By applying a binding source attribute (e.g., [FromBody]) to the parameter.
What is the role of the IServiceProviderIsService in ASP.NET Core?
It checks at app startup whether an argument in a controller action comes from DI or other sources.
What is the significance of BindingInfo.BindingSource when handling parameter binding?
It ensures that once a binding source is set, it is not overwritten during parameter binding.
How does ASP.NET Core assign BindingSource.Query to parameters?
Parameters that are not matched to routes, services, or the request body are assigned BindingSource.Query.
What is the SuppressInferBindingSourcesForParameters property used for?
It disables automatic inference of binding sources for parameters.
How does ASP.NET Core infer the binding source for complex types not registered in the DI container?
It infers BindingSource.Body for such types.
What is the purpose of the SuppressModelStateInvalidFilter in API behavior options?
It disables the automatic model validation check that triggers a 400 response.
How does the SuppressMapClientErrors property affect error mapping in API behavior?
It prevents automatic mapping of client errors, allowing custom error responses.
How can you map custom client error links, such as for 404 errors, in ASP.NET Core?
By setting ClientErrorMapping[StatusCodes.Status404NotFound].Link to a custom URL.
How do minimal APIs handle complex routes and authorization in ASP.NET Core?
Minimal APIs support defining complex routes and applying authorization through middleware and route handlers, similar to controller-based APIs.
What does the [ApiController] attribute infer for IFormFile and IFormFileCollection parameters?
It infers that the multipart/form-data request content type should be used.

By setting SuppressConsumesConstraintForFormFileParameters to true in ApiBehaviorOptions.
What property disables automatic inference of parameter binding sources in ASP.NET Core?
SuppressInferBindingSourcesForParameters.
What property disables automatic model validation error responses in ASP.NET Core APIs?
SuppressModelStateInvalidFilter.
How do you map a custom link for a 404 status code in ASP.NET Core?
By setting ClientErrorMapping[StatusCodes.Status404NotFound].Link to a custom URL.
What type does MVC return for an error status code 400 or higher?
ProblemDetails based on RFC 7807 specification.
What HTTP status code does NotFound() return?
It returns a 404 status code.
What type of response body does the NotFound() method generate?
It generates a ProblemDetails body in the response.
How do you disable automatic ProblemDetails creation for error status codes?
By setting SuppressMapClientErrors to true in ApiBehaviorOptions.
What attribute allows an action or controller to specify supported request content types?
The [Consumes] attribute.
What happens if a request with a content type not supported by an action is received?
A 415 Unsupported Media Type response is returned.
How do you limit an action to only handle application/xml content types?
By applying the [Consumes("application/xml")] attribute to the action.
What status code is returned if a request does not specify the correct content type required by the [Consumes] attribute?
A 415 Unsupported Media Type status code.
How does the [Consumes] attribute influence request selection in ASP.NET Core?
It applies a type constraint based on the incoming request's content type.
What content type is required for the PostJson action in the example provided?
application/json.
What content type is required for the PostForm action in the provided example?
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
What would happen if both PostJson and PostForm actions didn’t use the [Consumes] attribute and shared the same route?
An ambiguous match exception would be thrown.
What is the purpose of the [Consumes] attribute in the ConsumesController example?
It allows both actions to handle the same route with different content types without causing a route conflict.
What is the URL route for both PostJson and PostForm in the ConsumesController example?
They both handle requests sent to https://localhost:5001/api/Consumes.
How does the [Consumes] attribute prevent ambiguous matches between actions in ASP.NET Core?
By applying a type constraint based on the request's content type, ensuring each action handles only its specified content type.
General Return Types in ASP.NET Core

What are the four primary controller action return types in ASP.NET Core?
Specific type, IActionResult, ActionResult<T>, and HttpResults.
When is it most appropriate to use a specific type as a return type in ASP.NET Core?
When the action returns a primitive or complex data type and no multiple return types or error handling is required.
What is an example of a specific return type in ASP.NET Core?
Task<List<Product>> is a specific return type for returning a collection of Product objects.
When should IActionResult or ActionResult<T> be used in controller actions?
When multiple return types, such as different HTTP status codes, are possible.
Why is returning IEnumerable<T> not always recommended in ASP.NET Core?
ASP.NET Core buffers the result of actions returning IEnumerable<T> before writing them to the response.
What is the benefit of using IAsyncEnumerable<T> instead of IEnumerable<T> in ASP.NET Core?
IAsyncEnumerable<T> ensures asynchronous iteration, preventing buffering and improving performance.
How does System.Text.Json handle the result of actions returning IEnumerable<T>?
It supports streaming the result instead of buffering it.
IActionResult and ActionResult<T>

What is IActionResult typically used for in ASP.NET Core?
It is used when an action can return different HTTP status codes or result types.
Give an example of a shorthand method to return a BadRequest in ASP.NET Core.
return BadRequest(); is shorthand for return new BadRequestResult();.
What attribute helps describe possible HTTP responses for a web API action?
[ProducesResponseType] attribute.
In which scenarios is [ProducesResponseType] used?
When the action has multiple return types, making it necessary to specify the HTTP status codes and response types.
What HTTP status code does the NotFound method return?
404.
What HTTP status code does the Ok method return?
200.
Synchronous and Asynchronous Actions

What would a synchronous action return if a product is not found in the database?
A 404 status code with NotFound().
What would a synchronous action return if a product is found?
A 200 status code with Ok(product).
What does a 201 status code represent in ASP.NET Core?
The resource has been successfully created.
What does the CreatedAtAction method do in an action?
It returns a 201 status code and includes the location of the newly created resource.
In the asynchronous action example, what happens if a product's description contains "XYZ Widget"?
The action returns a 400 status code with BadRequest().
How does ASP.NET Core handle model validation errors in actions with the [ApiController] attribute?
It automatically returns a 400 status code for model validation failures.
ActionResult<T> vs IActionResult

What is a key advantage of using ActionResult<T> over IActionResult?
The [ProducesResponseType] attribute's Type property can be excluded, simplifying the response metadata.
Why does ActionResult<T> offer better type inference than IActionResult?
Because of implicit cast operators that support the conversion of both T and ActionResult to ActionResult<T>.
What happens if an action returns IEnumerable<T> in combination with ActionResult<T>?
Conversion to a concrete type like List<T> is required to use ActionResult<T>.
What status codes are returned in a synchronous action with ActionResult<Product> if the product is found or not found?
200 if the product is found, 404 if the product is not found.
What are the two possible return types in the asynchronous action with ActionResult<Product>?
A 201 status code for a created product and a 400 status code for a bad request.
HttpResults and IResult

What are HttpResults in ASP.NET Core?
They are a result implementation processed by IResult.ExecuteAsync, used in both Minimal APIs and Web APIs.
How do HttpResults differ from MVC-specific result types?
They don’t leverage configured formatters or support content negotiation.
What is the role of the IResult interface in ASP.NET Core?
It defines a contract representing the result of an HTTP endpoint.
What does the Results.Ok<T>() method return in an action?
A 200 status code with the corresponding object in the response body.
What method is used to return a 404 status code using IResult?
Results.NotFound().
What advantage do Results<TResult1, TResultN> union types offer in ASP.NET Core?
They automatically retain endpoint metadata and provide compile-time checking for declared return types.
